public class Theory {
	 //method declartion ==> method name line (only declartion)
	//method defination ==> code (actual code)
	//It is one of the oops principle polymorphism
	//poly-->multiple and morphism-->forms
	//Real life example-->a girl is daughter,mother,sister,wife,employee,pasenger,student
	//same person different where diff role
	//one form is many form there have two types .
	//1.complietime polymorphism 
	//2.runtime polymorphism
//********************************************************************************************************	
	    //1.complietime==>Before Run button click if any issue or dffect in program this called compile time issue.
	   // is known as early binding bcoz its decide to before run buttun click, thats why is known as earlybinding.
	  //is known as also ststic polymorphism
	 //Example --MethodOverloading
	//Bcoz compile time we know any error shows thats why its name is compiletime .
	//static non static also are overload.
	//method and constuctor also overload But constuctor not override.
//*********************************************************************************************************	
	   //2.runtime==>Afterm Run button click if any issue or dffect in console this called runtime issue.
	  // is known as late binding bcoz its decide to after run buttun click, thats why is known as latebinding.
	 //is known as also Dynamic polymorphism
	//Example --MethodOveriding
	
//*********************************************************************************************************	
	//Can we Overload main method ?
	//=>yes, with the help of diff parameter 
	//count of parameter must be diff
	//count of datatype must be diff
	//sequence of parameter must be diff
	//minimum 1class suffisent
//*********************************************************************************************************
	//Can we Override main method ?
	//==>No, Can not override mainmethod
	//bcoz main method is static and static cant override
//***************************************************************************************************************	
	//Declaring multiple method with same method name but with diff argument in same class,
	//is called MethodOverloading.
	//Bcoz compile time we know any error thats why its name is compiletime .
