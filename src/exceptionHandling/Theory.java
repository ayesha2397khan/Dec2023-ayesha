//There are 2 types of exception ------>1.Checked Exception 2.Unchecked Exception
//Checked Exception  ---->compile time exception---check exception on complie time thats way this Checked Exception
	//ex.filenotfound, classnotfound
//Unchecked Exception ---->run time exception --->run time on decide the exception thats way this Unchecked Exception
	//ex.nullpointerexception---when value not provide
	//runtime is most commenly exception which are handle by programs.
	
//Exception keywords 5:
	//try
	//catch
	//finally
	//throw
	//throws
	
//Handling The Exception	try catch
//1.Add risky code in try catch block
//2.Note ***risky code--->Always keeping in try block
//3.Count of catch block 1 or more than multiple
//4.Exception Classes handled by catch block are in Incerasing Order
//5.try,catch,finnaly---->one frame work
//6.Only 1 catch block execute one time	(last execution catch block having exception calss to handle)
//7.Catch block is mandatory
	
//finally Keyword
//1.finally block is opetional
//2.Maximum 1finally block
//3.And use finally block use in program only one time
//4.finally block always get execute 100% in any sichuation
	
//Interview Question diff bet final finally finalize 
//final 
	//1when varibale use final key this value can not be changed
	//2.When method use final key can not override the method
	//3.When class use final key we can not inhetite the any where
//finally	
	//1.finally is block avaliable in  try catch block
	//2.It is always avaliable in last
	//3.And it is opetional block
	//4.Each we mentiond a finally block it will definatly execute
//finalize
