//We can not create object in abstract class

//When use Interface keyword we know that method or class not any complete method ,All incomplete method.
//when methods are create in interface by defualt public & abstract.

	
	
	
//Why interface use multiple inheritance?
//Bcoz not any value provide in interface only declartion
//can not create class in multiple inheritance bcoz comiler get confused which,
//parent class defination code are used parent 1 or parent 2,
//And in interface only methods declaration, and definataions provides *child* class thats why ,
//multiple inheritance use interface.

	
	
//when complete method inside the interface use static
