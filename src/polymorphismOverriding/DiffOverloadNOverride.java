// method overload is known as compile time,static and early polymorphism

//In method overload we can make method any same name diff parameter(multiple & same name)
//In method overriding inheritance is important parent to child ,method name should be same
	
//In method overload method and parameter in diff.
//In method overriding method and parameter must be same(method exactly same).
	
//In method overload minimum 1 class requiered
//In method overriding minimum 2 class requiered
	
//In method overload no need to used any keyword
//In method overriding used extends keyword
	
//In method overload syntax ---->M1(){……},	     M1(int a, int b){…....};
//In method overriding syntax--->Class A extends B

//Q.1 How to stop method overloading/How will you avoid mehod overloading?
//--->Change the method name (Unique method name )
	
//Q.2 How to stop method overrding/How will you avoid mehod overrding?
//--->Create Method is Private ,final, static then stop.

//In method overload ,Overloadding of constructor is possible.
//In method overriding, Overridding of constructor is not possible
	
//Overloadding --main method is overload is possible.
//Overridding --No, becoz main method is static.
