//Xpath stands for XML Path Language,
//Xpath is used to find the location of any element on a webpage using HTML DOM structure,
//it was defined by the world wide web consortium(W3C),
//xpath is used to nevigate nodes in any xml documnet,xpath uses "path like"syntax
//Xpath is populer than css 2 types=1.absoulate xpath 2.relative xpath
	
//absoulate xpath--->start from root --body i.e. html but its not user frendly ,
	//And it will nevigate to imidiate parent to imidiate child, 
	//It is very difficult to proper read code,
	//We will nevigate one element to imidiate child,.
	//It contains the complete path from the root element of page to the desiered element,
	//Absoluate xpath starts with root node--Single forword slash( / )
	//Drwaback of using absoluate xpath--Any slight change in DOM makes the xpath invalid.
	
//relative xpath--->it will be nevigate to one element to any child.
	//With relative xpath,the starts from the mid of the HTML DOM structure
	//it begain with the double forword slash( // )
	//it represent to by using  // which means any child
	//It is less brittle.
